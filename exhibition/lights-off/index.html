                We represented the people you would meet, what kind of far-out trip you would have, or even reveal the mysteries of the universe. We were an acid test pop quiz on a telephone pole.

                Now many of us live at the Letterform Archive. Protected in plastic slips or hung up on the wall, with a unique lighting style similar to this. You may have missed the show but you can always enjoy us here.
